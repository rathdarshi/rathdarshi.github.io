The human eye is an incredibly complex object, and many changes that occur in the retina can be linked to various physical diseases. This paper investigates a new method for detecting vessel junctions in the human retina, which are linked to said diseases. Using a new feature vector called the Vessel Keypoint Detector, the system first <i>identifies</i> vessel junction points using a combination of Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques. After identification, the system also <i>classifies</i> the vessel junctions as either <i>bifurcations</i> or <i>crossovers</i>, since both are important for tracking different classes of diseases. Additionally, the system may be deployed for performing vessel analysis for biometric tracking.
